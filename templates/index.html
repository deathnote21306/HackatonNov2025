        Created during the <strong>MAIS Hacks 2025 Hackathon</strong>, this project explores how 
        <strong>AI-driven agents</strong> can assist in medical contexts by answering patient calls, 
        providing basic symptom guidance, and scheduling follow-up appointments.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
        Our goal is to build an intelligent system that helps healthcare professionals handle non-emergency 
        calls efficiently, while ensuring accessibility and safety for all users.

    <p class="text-muted mx-auto" style="max-width: 700px;">
        This project was built by McGill students for the <strong>MAIS Hacks 2025</strong> competition, combining 
        <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Twilio</strong>, and <strong>AI speech models</strong> to demonstrate how 
        machine learning can make healthcare communication more efficient and accessible.
